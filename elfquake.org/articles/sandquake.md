# Sandquake

An attempt at generating synthetic data that is similar enough to signals from seismic events (acoustic and electromagnetic) to train an ML model, based on the [Abelian sandpile model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model)

[sandquake repo](https://github.com/danja/sandquake) is included as a git submodule in [elfquake.org](https://github.com/danja/elfquake)
